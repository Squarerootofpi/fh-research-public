-  **Check the sources to generate each person, and if it doesn't match a current person in familysearch, update the information.**
  - Figure out how to check what things a source is attached to.

- Merge any duplicates, or delete persons




2 well researched people in which a bunch of duplicates seem to be similar to:
https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/G9Q5-3P5
https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/G9QG-2DY

These two people are not even attached or considered duplicates to the ones below. It seems to me that the way to resolve all these bad duplicates are to go directly to the sources. So, I need to find if I can see who these sources are attached to or not. 

## John Poole 

There seem to be a bunch of duplicates of this person. 
It was created by familysearch christening records in 2012, and I just have to figure out the info for each of the sources. Essentially, there is a log for a christening for a child, and each mom/dad/child combination was created in familysearch for this record. 

Some of the records seem to have Pool rather than Pool**e**. Pooles without E's. 

This table is ordered by the year or christening.

*M9M1-5QY is the only one that doesn't have any sources, and has some of my collaboration notes on it. 

All of the other pids have exactly one source.
